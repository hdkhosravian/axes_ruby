# README
I'm trying to create a machine learning NLP project with Python, Ruby on Rails and React.
I created this project with `AXES` name, and you can access to complete of the project with this address: [Axes World](http://www.axes.world) ( I'm working on it to make it alive, so please wait for a little)
<br />
I'm using `Ruby on Rails` & `React on Rails` for this project, but because of some copyrights I had to remove the UI and tests from this repositories, I didn't remove the base of the architect of React that I used in this project so you can use it if you want. You can check it here: `client/bundle/...`.

I have a plan to add new tests and UI to the project in the future (ASAP).

# Copyright
You can use this project if you want, but you must mention my name in your project.

# configuring

### Docker configurations:

#### make a copy from `docker-compose.sample.yml` and `docker.sample.env` then remove `sample` from your copies. Make changes on your docker files.
Use this command to run docker:

- docker-compose build
- docker-compose up

use can use `docker-compose up -d` to run the project in the background.

### also you can run the project in your system manually

#### make a copy from `database.sample.yml` and `storage.sample.yml` then remove `sample` from the name. Make changes on your files. Install gems with `bundle install`, then run ` rails credentials:edit` to generate you rails secret keys. Create and migrate the database with `rake db:create` and `rake db:migrate`.

then you can run server with:
### foreman start -f Procfile.dev
### foreman start -f Procfile.dev-server
